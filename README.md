## Question (KPIs)
     Total Revenue
     Average Order Value
     Total Pizzas Sold
     Total No. of Orders
     Average Pizzas per Order

## Charts to Develop
     Daily Trends for Total Orders
     Hourly Trends for Total Orders
     Pie and donut charts to break down sales % by category and size
     Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
     Top 5 Best sellers by Total Orders
     Bottom 5 Worst seller by Total Orders
     Slicer for time-based filtering (Quarter , Year)

## 💡 Project Workflow
**1. Data Cleaning**


    Cleaned raw pizza order data using Excel (handled missing values, column naming, data types).

**2. SQL Analysis**

* Imported cleaned dataset into MySQL.

* Wrote multiple SQL queries to calculate:

        Total Revenue

        Average Order Value

        Pizzas Sold

        Daily/Hourly Order Trends

        Best/Worst Sellers

        Category/Size-wise Sales Distribution

**3. Excel Dashboard**

        Created Pivot Tables, Charts, and KPIs.

        All values cross-verified with SQL results for accuracy.

**Note:** This project is adapted from a publicly available tutorial. It was completed as a self-learning exercise to enhance my data analysis and dashboarding skills.

**All SQL queries, dashboard designs, and interpretations were created by me as part of the hands-on practice process.**
